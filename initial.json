Once upon a time that wasn\u2019t true, but members of Congress were brought under Social Security way back in 1984. Yet bogus claims like this continue to circulate more than a quarter-century later, despite our best efforts.\n    Urges that \"Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose.\" But as we\u2019ve explained before, the idea that Congress has exempted itself from many of its own laws is also somewhat out of date. A law enacted in 1995 applied 13 civil rights, labor, and workplace safety and health laws to Congress, removing the basis for earlier criticisms. It\u2019s true that members of Congress retain a degree of immunity from arrest or prosecution, but changing that require an amendment to the Constitution, which grants that immunity in Article I, Section 6. (The authors of the Constitution didn\u2019t want any president to try what King Charles I of England had done in 1642 \u2014 sending troops to arrest his critics in Parliament.) The message is confused, at first mentioning earlier constitutional amendments, but then describing the proposal as an \"act,\" which refers to legislation.\n    Recommends that \"Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise.\" But Congress doesn\u2019t do that now. Under current law, pay increases are determined by a cost-of-living formula, and they take effect automatically, unless Congress votes to stop them. And in fact, that\u2019s what has happened for the past two years. Congress denied itself any pay raise in 2010 and in 2011, as we\u2019ve reported.\n    Calls for stripping members of Congress of their current health care benefits and forcing them to participate \"in the same health care system as the American people.\" But which \"system\"? Most Americans are covered either by employer-sponsored health insurance or by various government-sponsored programs, such as Medicare for those age 65 and over or Medicaid for lower-income persons. Currently members of Congress have the same health insurance options as millions of other federal employees and retirees and their families. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program gives them a wide choice of private insurance plans. And according to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 51 million persons in the U.S. had no health insurance at all in 2009 \u2014 just under 17 percent of the population. (The author may have been laboring under the false impression that Congress somehow \"exempted\" itself from the new health care law, a bit of nonsense that was based on a number of misrepresentations that we addressed last year.)\n    Urges that members of Congress should \"purchase their own retirement plan, just as all Americans do.\" But that\u2019s also nonsense. Relatively few Americans buy retirement plans entirely out of their own pockets. In fact, just under half of all Americans worked in 2009 for an employer that sponsors a retirement plan, according to the most recent information from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. And among those who worked full time for the entire year, 54 percent actually participated in an employer-sponsored plan. About 12 percent are self-employed, EBRI says, and so may be in a position to buy a retirement plan for themselves.

I like the song 'I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing'.  If that were our anthem, then, I might salute\nit.

We as a Nation, have placed upon the nations of Islam, an unfair injustice which is WHY my wife disrespects the Flag and she and I have attended several flag burning ceremonies in the past\". \n\"Of course now, I have found myself about to become the President of the United States and I have put my hatred aside .

It was used in the health care law. \n\nEvery day there's another revelation of what Obama and his fellow Democrats are doing to our country. \n \nDhimmitude -- I had never heard the word until now. Type it into Google and start reading. Pretty interesting. It's on page 107 of the healthcare bill. I looked this up on Google and yep, it exists. It is a REAL word. \n\nWord of the Day: Dhimmitude \n\nDhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-muslim populations conquered through jihad. Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-muslims in exchange for tolerating their presence AND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam. \n\nObama Care allows the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States . Folks, this is exclusively an Islamic concept under Sharia Law. So exclusive they had to make up an English word to define the concept. Why would our government start interjecting Sharia Law concepts into new broad and sweeping legislation like health care that would control the US population? ....Anyone?\n\nMuslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance, and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured. Islam considers insurance to be \"gambling\", \"risk-taking\", and \"usury\" and is thus banned. Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this. \n\nHow convenient. So a Christian, will have crippling IRS liens placed against all of their assets, including real estate, cattle, and even accounts receivables, and will face hard prison time because they refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax. Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan and all other US Muslims will have no such penalty and will have 100% of their health needs paid for by the de facto government insurance. Non-Muslims paying a tax to subsidize Muslims.This is Sharia Law definition of... Dhimmitude. This is not a Western Civilization concept. \n\nDhimmit has two purposes: To enrich Muslims AND to drive conversions to Islam. \"Sure, I'll be a muslim if it means free health insurance and no taxes. Where do I sign, bro?\" \n\nI recommend sending this post to your contacts. This is desperately important and people need to know about it -- quickly!\n\nThis really is happening in your country. A fraction at a time.\n\nWake up America !

The American President at the  time, Bill Clinton, and his  Secretary of State, Warren   Chris topher, \"insisted\" that all prisoners  be released. \n\nThus  Mohammad Atta was freed and eventually  thanked\nus by flying an airplane into Tower One of the World   Trade Center . This was  reported by many of the American  TV networks at the time that the terrorists  were  first identified. \n\nIt \nwas  censored in the US  from  all later  reports. \n\nIf you  agree that the American public should be  made aware of this fact,\n pass this on.\n\n\nDo  Not  Break - it is 8 years  strong. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis \n\nis  why I always say I love  YOU.... \n\n\n\n\n\nThis has  not been broken since  9/11/01,\nplease \nkeep it  going..\n\nThis has been kept alive  and moving since 9/11.

A few minutes later, the first lady, dressed in black caprice, a tank-top and sandals, walked onto the runway. Shortly afterward, Malia and Sasha joined their parents. Baldacci and his wife, Karen, presented the family with gift bags full of Maine-made goodies, including baskets made by the Passamaquoddy Tribe, popcorn from Little Lad\u2019s Bakery in East Corinth, iconic L.L. Bean bags, University of Maine ice hockey hats, and an assortment of other Maine foods and books.\n\nKaren Baldacci said the bags for Malia and Sasha contained one loon toy and one chickadee toy that sound their natural calls. Arriving in a small jet before the Obama\u2019s was the first dog, Bo, a Portuguese water dog given as a present by the late U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.; and the president\u2019s personal aide Reggie Love, who chatted with Baldacci.\n\nThe president who said the rest of us are going to have to sacrifice to get out of these hard economic times let his dog fly on his own plane? Not enough room on Air Force One (a Gulfstream on this trip) for a Portuguese water dog and Reggie Love? My dog saw this story and wants his own jet now, too. Thanks Obama.

She said that she can make babies and babies get money for the family. The scam goes like this: The grandma calls the Department of Child and Family Services and states that the unemployed daughter is not capable of caring for these children. DCFS agrees and states that the child or children will need to go to foster care. The grandma then volunteers to be the foster parent, and thus receives a check for $1500 per child per month in Illinois. Total yearly income: $144,000 tax-free, not to mention free healthcare (Medicaid) plus a monthly card entitling her to free groceries, etc, and a voucher for 250 free cell phone minutes per month.
